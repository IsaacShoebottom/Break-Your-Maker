# Break Your Maker

The game so far is pretty simple. 

You emerge from a cloning pod, and you have to beat the plant boss.

First your must find the key. It is in a room with chest that opens when you approach it. It is blue and red and reassembles two barrels stuck to each other

Optionally you can pick up a powerup, which will either increase your damage and change your projectile type or increase your health

You must then walk back to the boss room and defeat the boss. The boss is a plant that shoots projectiles at you that are telegraphed. It will also bite you if you get too close. It has a lot of health, and you must defeat it to win the game.
